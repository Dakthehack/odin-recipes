    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan, often called "Chicken Parm," is a classic Italian-American dish. It consists of breaded chicken breast, pan-fried or baked, and topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese, usually mozzarella and sometimes Parmesan. The chicken cutlet is first seasoned, dredged in flour, dipped in beaten eggs, and then coated in breadcrumbs, often with Italian herbs like basil and oregano for extra flavor. After cooking, it's topped with marinara sauce and cheese, then baked or broiled until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</p>

    <p>Chicken Parmesan is typically served over spaghetti or another type of pasta and garnished with fresh basil or parsley. It’s a comforting, flavorful dish combining the crispiness of the breaded chicken with the tangy tomato sauce and creamy, melted cheese for a savory and satisfying meal.</p>
