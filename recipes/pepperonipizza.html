    <h2>Steps</h2>      
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Prepare the Dough
          <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, olive oil, and salt, and mix until a dough forms. Knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2: Preheat Oven and Prepare Sauce
          <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the tomato sauce with oregano, basil, minced garlic (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3: Shape the Dough
          <ul>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 2 portions if you want two pizzas.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle or your desired thickness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4: Assemble the Pizza
          <ul>
            <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza pan or a lightly floured pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce and then add pepperoni slices on top.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5: Bake
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer the pizza to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6: Serve
          <ul>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, slice, and enjoy your homemade pepperoni pizza!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
